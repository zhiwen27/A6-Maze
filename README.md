Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
The preparation of working through the prototype and think about how a real maze could be sovled was very helpful.
When doing the assignment, following the logic developed in the prototype with recursion, thinking through which grids to be marked as DEAD_END, VISITED or PATH was challenging. However, getting the maze displayed in the end was really interesting.
