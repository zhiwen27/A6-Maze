Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
The preparation of prototyping how to work through a real maze beforehand is very helpful. During the process of writing the code,following the logic developed in prototype, thinking through which grids to be marked as DEAD_END, VISITED or PATH is challenging. However, the process of getting the maze displayed is really interesting.
