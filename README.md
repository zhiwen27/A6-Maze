Do you have any remaining questions about this assignment? No.

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
The preparation of working through the prototype and thinking about how a real maze could be sovled recursively was very helpful.
When doing the assignment, changing the logic developed in the prototype with recursion to codes as well as thinking through which grids to be marked as DEAD_END, VISITED or PATH was challenging. However, getting the maze solution displayed in the end was really interesting.
